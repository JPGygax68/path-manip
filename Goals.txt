Path.js: a JavaScript module for handling paths
-----------------------------------------------

Motivation
----------

Working with paths in JavaScript is somewhat less than fun. It's far from difficult, yet it lacks elegance and simplicity, and mistakes are easily made.

In my opinion, working with paths should be done with the help of a specialized class, much like the boost C++ library does it (though I don't intend at this point to mimick their API).


Brackets
--------

- Must work with Un*x and Windows-style paths (it must support Windows-style roots like "X:\", and support a toNative() method in Node)
- Concatenation should handle "climbing" ("..") segments
- It must support both CommonJS and AMD loading

Approach
--------

- Subclass Array - gives the class abilities that should feel "natural"
- Provide a toString() method to convert to string easily and naturally (for JS)
